# David-sMightyWarriors
## Date: 9/11/22
## Written by Yaniv Tawily
## The Program:
### My purpose in writing the program is to compare the similar parts of the Tanakh,
### By that I mean that they are the same text in two different versions in the Tanakh.
### For example David's heroes who are shown in the II Samuel (ch 23) and in I Chronicles (ch 11).
### For the demonstration I used both of them in the program, but it can be used on other texts as well.
### The text I took from using the API library of Sefaria.
### I deliberately chose a Version with Ta'amei Hamikra and Nikkud so i can show the use of regular expressions.
### I scanned the two sections of text using fuzzy matching to find the different words between the two texts.
